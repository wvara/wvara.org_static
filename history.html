When Ray died, his call sign was assigned to the club as a          memorial to him.</p>        <p>The            early Field Day use of the W6PIY call sign resulted in the phonetics &quot;Poor            Idiot Yelling&quot;.</p>        <p>Ray used to live behind Frank Glass (K6RQ) on National Avenue before          Ray became a silent key. Frank recalls that Ray was a retired Coast          Guard lighthouse keeper.        </p>        <p>Ray was a member of WVARA when Frank (then W6MVL) was President in          1956-1957.        </p>        <p>Ray may have been an original WVARA member when WVARA had it's first          President, Dick Drew (K6BYG) in 1953-1954. Or possibly when Al Townsend          (W6TXT ?) was President in 1954-1955, or when Earle Greer (W6HWS, silent          key) was President in 1955-1956.        </p>        <p>Initial WVARA meetings were held in Dick Drew's living room. Later          WVARA meetings moved to an Italian cafe in &quot;downtown&quot; Campbell          and then to the old Cambrian school in the late 1950's around the time          Ray Dibb died. The school is now long gone and has been replaced by          housing in the Bascom and Curtner area.        </p>        <p>Actually in Ray Dibb's time the name was West Valley Amateur Radio          Club (WVARC). Later when the club registered as non-profit          organization, a name scan showed there was already a WVARC, so the          club had to become WVARA for incorporation.        </p>        <p>Based on an e-mails from Frank Glass (K6RQ, ex W6MVL)</p>      <p>Marc, W6ZZZ</p></td>  </tr>   <tr>     <td width="160">&nbsp;</td>     <td width="564">&nbsp;</td>   </tr> </table> <table width="724" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">   <tr>     <td class="bottom-links"><a href="index.html">home</a> <a href="activities.html">activities</a> <a href="onair.html">repeaters</a> <a href="meetings.html">meetings</a> <a href="news.html">news</a> <a href="officials.html">officers</a><br />       <a href="membership.html">membership</a> <a href="onair.html">on the air</a> <a href="fd/index.html">Field    Day</a> <a href="email.html">email lists</a> <a href="history.html">About WVARA</a> <a href="links.html">Links</a> </td>   </tr> </table> </body></html>
