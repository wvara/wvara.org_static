                and in the case of interference the non-primary station(s) will
                have to mitigate the problem (rotate their antenna, move to another

        </center>
        </font> <p class="default-10">That's a good question, and if you asked ten hams, you would probably get ten different answers. Some would say that Field Day is a contest, others would say that it is an emergency preparedness exercise, still others would say that it is a party and yet others would say that it is a public relations exercise. Who is right? They all are! Field Day is all of those things and more. The best description anyone can find is that Field Day is all of ham radio in one weekend!</p>
        <p>During Field Day, ham radio clubs, groups
            and individuals take to the field in simulated emergency conditions
          (living in tents and running on generators and batteries). They are given
          24 hours to set up as many stations as they are able. In the next 24
          hours they are try to make as many contacts as they can with those stations.
          All aspects of ham radio are used in this pursuit. More than a million
          contacts will be made on HF and VHF, CW, SSB and digital modes this weekend.
          Bonus points are awarded for making an extra effort such as making contacts
          via satellites or sending and receiving message traffic. </p>      <p> Field Day isn't just about radio though. Clubs use this biggest of
          all yearly events for many other activities. With much of the clubs membership
          assembled it is a natural time for BBQ's and other gatherings. Also with
          all of ham radio on display this weekend it is a choice time to show
          off what we do best. The media and government officials are invited to
          attend to view what ham radio can do. </p>
        <p> As you can see, Field Day is indeed all of ham radio in one weekend
          and anyone that attends their first Field Day rarely misses one again! </p>

        <p> While Field Day isn't strictly a contest, that is how the entrants
          are rated and why not? A contest is a great way to evaluate a stations
          performance. It is also a great way to simulate message handling which
          will be a big part of any response to an emergency. </p>
        <p> So what is a contest? Put most simply, in a contest the objective is
          to make as many contacts in as many places as possible in a prescribed
          ammount of time. For Field Day, the objective is simply to make as many
          contacts as possible in the 24 hours you are alloted. To make those contacts
          valid, you have to exchange a certain ammount of information. The "exchange" for
          Field Day is your entry class (number of transmitters) and your ARRL
          section. </p>
        <p> So how do you go about making these contacts? Just as you would for
          any other QSO in amateur radio, there are only two ways to initiate a
          conversation. You either have to answer someone who is calling CQ or
          call CQ yourself and wait for someone to answer you. Which method is
          better? It is generally accepted that staying in one place, calling CQ
          and letting the other stations come to you is quicker and less tiring.
          However, this only works if you have a signal that is loud enough to
          attract other stations. If you aren't making any contacts or aren't making
          them fast enough, you are forced to switch to the search and pounce method.
          Excelent operators can rack up the QSOs almost as fast this way. Which
          ever method you employ, a Field Day contact sounds like this: </p>
        <blockquote> <font color="#FF0000"> CQ Field Day CQ Field Day this is W6PIY
            Whiskey Six Papa India Yankee calling CQ Field Day and listening. </font><br />
          Whiskey One Alfa Whiskey. <br />
          <font color="#FF0000"> W1AW thank you, we are Eleven Alfa, Santa Clara
          Valley, over. </font><br />
          Thank you, we are Six Delta, Connecticut, over. <br />
          <font color="#FF0000">Thank you, this is W6PIY Whiskey Six Papa India
          Yankee, QRZ? </font> </blockquote>
        All that is left is to record the contact on your log sheet and get ready
        for the next contact.
        <p> Obviously because of the variability of radio propagation and other
          factors, many contacts aren't this neat and clean. This is especially
          true when multiple people are calling you or you are getting interference
          from another station, but learning to deal with these conditions are
          part of the lure and purpose of Field Day! </p></td>
