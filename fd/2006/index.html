              <p class="default-bold">Field Day is less than 2 months away. Yee-Haw!</p>
              <p>Current plans include the following:</p>
              <p>We'll be operating QRP from Moran Hill in the Rancho San Antonio
                Open Space Preserve (same location as last year). This is a hilltop
                site above Los Altos Hills with excellent line-of-sight coverage
                of the Bay Area.</p>
              <p>This year we'll have five HF stations on the air -- a digital
                HF station, a CW HF station, a GOTA station (for beginners in
                HF SSB operating), along with TWO other SSB HF stations. Antennas
                will include a tower-mounted yagi, a 20m quad, and a balloon-supported
                80m loop. We'll also have dedicated stations on 2m, 6m and 10m,
                and whatever other stations are needed to get us up to 8A. </p>
              <p>So mark your calendars -- Field Day is June 22-24. And feel
                free to send me an email if you'd like to get involved in the
                preparations.</p>

              <p class="default-bold">Latest FD News, 2006 </p>
              <p class="default-bold">Awesome Field Day Results</p>
              <p>The results are in and can be viewed at the ARRL website. The
                bottom line: WVARA did fantastic!!! Here's a quick run-down of
                the results:</p>
              <p>W6PIY scored 9,190 points in the 9AB category (i.e. 9A running
                battery)</p>
              <p>Of all 113 stations in Pacific Division, W6PIY was #6 -- in
                the top 5%, very excellent!</p>
              <p>Of the 32 stations in Santa Clara Valley, W6PIY was #3. (The
                W6YX station at Stanford came in #1 but was operating from a
                permanent site with fixed towers, etc -- hardly a fair comparison.</p>
              <p>And we would have set an all-time new record score for 9A, except
                that VE3MA ran up an amazing score of 19,841 -- but I'm happy
                to have the second-highest 9A score in history!</p>

              Day is that hams can operate on modes and bands that they can't
              normally use. Hams that have HF privledges often act as control
              operators at their stations allowing those without HF privledges
              to operate on the HF bands. Many a new ham has gotten their first
              taste of HF operating at Field Day. For more information, see the <i><a href="#howto-contest">How

        </font> <p class="default-10">That's a good question, and if you asked ten hams, you would probably get ten different answers. Some would say that Field Day is a contest, others would say that it is an emergency preparedness exercise, still others would say that it is a party and yet others would say that it is a public relations exercise. Who is right? They all are! Field Day is all of those things and more. The best description anyone can find is that Field Day is all of ham radio in one weekend!</p>
        <p>During Field Day, ham radio clubs, groups
            and individuals take to the field in simulated emergency conditions
          (living in tents and running on generators and batteries). They are given
          24 hours to set up as many stations as they are able. In the next 24
          hours they are try to make as many contacts as they can with those stations.
          All aspects of ham radio are used in this pursuit. More than a million
          contacts will be made on HF and VHF, CW, SSB and digital modes this weekend.
          Bonus points are awarded for making an extra effort such as making contacts
          via satellites or sending and receiving message traffic. </p>      <p> Field Day isn't just about radio though. Clubs use this biggest of
          all yearly events for many other activities. With much of the clubs membership
          assembled it is a natural time for BBQ's and other gatherings. Also with
          all of ham radio on display this weekend it is a choice time to show
          off what we do best. The media and government officials are invited to
          attend to view what ham radio can do. </p>
        <p> As you can see, Field Day is indeed all of ham radio in one weekend
          and anyone that attends their first Field Day rarely misses one again! </p>

        </center>
        <p></p>
        </font>
        <p> While Field Day isn't strictly a contest, that is how the entrants
          are rated and why not? A contest is a great way to evaluate a stations
          performance. It is also a great way to simulate message handling which
          will be a big part of any response to an emergency. </p>
        <p> So what is a contest? Put most simply, in a contest the objective is
          to make as many contacts in as many places as possible in a prescribed
          ammount of time. For Field Day, the objective is simply to make as many
          contacts as possible in the 24 hours you are alloted. To make those contacts
          valid, you have to exchange a certain ammount of information. The "exchange" for
          Field Day is your entry class (number of transmitters) and your ARRL
          section. </p>
        <p> So how do you go about making these contacts? Just as you would for
          any other QSO in amateur radio, there are only two ways to initiate a
          conversation. You either have to answer someone who is calling CQ or
          call CQ yourself and wait for someone to answer you. Which method is
          better? It is generally accepted that staying in one place, calling CQ
          and letting the other stations come to you is quicker and less tiring.
          However, this only works if you have a signal that is loud enough to
          attract other stations. If you aren't making any contacts or aren't making
          them fast enough, you are forced to switch to the search and pounce method.
          Excelent operators can rack up the QSOs almost as fast this way. Which
          ever method you employ, a Field Day contact sounds like this: </p>
        <blockquote> <font color="#FF0000"> CQ Field Day CQ Field Day this is W6PIY
            Whiskey Six Papa India Yankee calling CQ Field Day and listening. </font><br />
          Whiskey One Alfa Whiskey. <br />
          <font color="#FF0000"> W1AW thank you, we are Eleven Alfa, Santa Clara
          Valley, over. </font><br />
          Thank you, we are Six Delta, Connecticut, over. <br />
          <font color="#FF0000">Thank you, this is W6PIY Whiskey Six Papa India
          Yankee, QRZ? </font> </blockquote>
        All that is left is to record the contact on your log sheet and get ready
        for the next contact.
        <p> Obviously because of the variability of radio propagation and other
          factors, many contacts aren't this neat and clean. This is especially
          true when multiple people are calling you or you are getting interference
          from another station, but learning to deal with these conditions are
          part of the lure and purpose of Field Day! </p></td>
