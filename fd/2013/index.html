            <p class="default-10">That's a good question, and if you asked ten hams, you would probably get ten different answers. Some would say that Field Day is a contest, others would say that it is an emergency preparedness exercise, still others would say that it is a party and yet others would say that it is a public relations exercise. Who is right? They all are! Field Day is all of those things and more. The best description anyone can find is that Field Day is all of ham radio in one weekend!</p>
            <p>During Field Day, ham radio clubs, groups              and individuals take to the field in simulated emergency conditions              (living in tents and running on generators and batteries). They are given              24 hours to set up as many stations as they are able. In the next 24              hours they are try to make as many contacts as they can with those stations.              All aspects of ham radio are used in this pursuit. More than a million              contacts will be made on HF and VHF, CW, SSB and digital modes this weekend.              Bonus points are awarded for making an extra effort such as making contacts              via satellites or sending and receiving message traffic. </p>
            <p> Field Day isn't just about radio though. Clubs use this biggest of              all yearly events for many other activities. With much of the clubs membership              assembled it is a natural time for BBQ's and other gatherings. Also with              all of ham radio on display this weekend it is a choice time to show              off what we do best. The media and government officials are invited to              attend to view what ham radio can do. </p>
            <p> As you can see, Field Day is indeed all of ham radio in one weekend              and anyone that attends their first Field Day rarely misses one again! </p>

              <a name="howto-contest" class="headings">How to Contest</a>
            </center>
            </font>
            <p> While Field Day isn't strictly a contest, that is how the entrants              are rated and why not? A contest is a great way to evaluate a stations              performance. It is also a great way to simulate message handling which              will be a big part of any response to an emergency. </p>
            <p> So what is a contest? Put most simply, in a contest the objective is              to make as many contacts in as many places as possible in a prescribed              ammount of time. For Field Day, the objective is simply to make as many              contacts as possible in the 24 hours you are alloted. To make those contacts              valid, you have to exchange a certain ammount of information. The "exchange" for              Field Day is your entry class (number of transmitters) and your ARRL              section. </p>
            <p> So how do you go about making these contacts? Just as you would for              any other QSO in amateur radio, there are only two ways to initiate a              conversation. You either have to answer someone who is calling CQ or              call CQ yourself and wait for someone to answer you. Which method is              better? It is generally accepted that staying in one place, calling CQ              and letting the other stations come to you is quicker and less tiring.              However, this only works if you have a signal that is loud enough to              attract other stations. If you aren't making any contacts or aren't making              them fast enough, you are forced to switch to the search and pounce method.              Excelent operators can rack up the QSOs almost as fast this way. Which              ever method you employ, a Field Day contact sounds like this: </p>
            <blockquote> <font color="#FF0000"> CQ Field Day CQ Field Day this is W6PIY              Whiskey Six Papa India Yankee calling CQ Field Day and listening. </font><br />
              Whiskey One Alfa Whiskey. <br />
              <font color="#FF0000"> W1AW thank you, we are Eleven Alfa, Santa Clara              Valley, over. </font><br />
              Thank you, we are Six Delta, Connecticut, over. <br />
              <font color="#FF0000">Thank you, this is W6PIY Whiskey Six Papa India              Yankee, QRZ? </font> </blockquote>
            All that is left is to record the contact on your log sheet and get ready            for the next contact.
            <p> Obviously because of the variability of radio propagation and other              factors, many contacts aren't this neat and clean. This is especially              true when multiple people are calling you or you are getting interference              from another station, but learning to deal with these conditions are              part of the lure and purpose of Field Day! </p></td>
