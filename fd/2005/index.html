            <p class="default-10">Bill Ashby has confirmed that we have a use
              permit for
            the San Felipe site at Grant Ranch Park.</p>
            <p class="default-10">Band Captains, we need you. 10m, 15m 40m CW and
              Digital, along with 80m and 160m are wide open. 220
              MHz, 440 MHz, along with 1.2 GHz are also open. Please
              sign up either by e-mailing me or at the next meeting.</p>
            <p class="default-10">Jim Peterson (K6EI), if the individuals from the ESL
              club wish to work any of the open sections this year,
              it is okay by me, if our club members do not want to
              sign up as a band captain. Mark Ziegler (W6ZZZ) that
              goes for you too, if the members of the Loma Prieta
              ARC what to come down and work a few stations, that's
              okay also.</p>
            <p class="default-10">To the rest of the members, if you know any members of
              any other clubs, associations, or organizations that
              do not have enough members to set-up their own field
              day site, please invite them to participate with us at
              field day this year. It goes for youth groups as
              well.</p>
            <p class="default-10">Bill Ashby (N6FFC) and I are proposing a couple of
              walk-throughs at the site, with one tentative
              scheduled for May 14 (Saturday) along with a final
              walk-through the first weekend in June. If a
              walk-through is needed in April, that will be
              determined at the next meeting.</p>
            <p class="default-10">We will be allowed the use of the generator, we will
              have to keep it in the parking lot for the duration.
              If the fire marshal indicates that we must cease the
              use of the generator (i.e., a red flag day), I am
              encouraging all members to bring a fully-charged 12
              volt battery for use in case we have to shut off the
              generator.</p>
            <p class="default-10">We will not use liquid fuel for cooking, rather we
              will have propane stoves available along with plenty
              of charcoal for barbecuing in the barbecue pit.</p>
            <p class="default-10">The site is physically bigger than Charlie's place, we
              should have no problem setting up the radio systems
            while conforming to the 1000' </p>
            <p class="default-10">Oh yes, MASTS... MY YXL and I went to Schad's
              Electronics on South First Street in San Jose Saturday
              and procured a collapsible 50 foot , you heard right,
              a collapsible 50 foot mast.</p>
            <p class="default-10">It is made by Channel Master and it's model number is
              1650. It is a very beefy mast, one adult could
              transport it, but keeping on the side of safety, two
              adults are better.</p>
            <p class="default-10">The mast is made from 16/18 gage cold rolled steel, it
              is definitely not a flimsy radio-shack mast. They
              have a large number of masts currently in stock. The
              price of the mast is approximately 85.00 not including
              tax.</p>
            <p class="default-10">This mast has five (5) separate sections with each
              section having it's own guy wire ring, with the
              capacity of setting up five (5) separate guy wires per
              ring. Each section collapses down within the outer
              section. The base diameter is approximately three (3)
              inches in diameter.</p>
            <p class="default-10">We can discuss the safest way to raise this mast,
              especially with regards to the base section of this
              mast and the number of guy wires to use on each mast,
              at the next meeting.</p>
            <p class="default-10">Keeping safety in mind, I am suggesting that all
              personnel involved in raising and lowering these masts
              wear a 'hard hat'. I have a source of hard hats are
              very low cost here in Fremont. We can discuss these
              topics at the next meeting.</p>
            <p class="default-10">This mast will accommodate a rotator such as a Hy-gain
              CD4511 with a mast support unit attached to the
              rotator,or a gin pole pulley cap on top for use with a
              dipole antenna.</p>
            <p class="default-10">One last item for now, if our webmaster would be so
              kind as to update our website indicating the new
              location for field day this year and remove any
              reference to Charlie's place, I would appreciate it
              ever so much.</p>
            <p class="default-10">I guess thats enough for now, any questions, comments,
              or concerns please e-mail now so they can be resolved
              prior to field day.</p>

              event on the USA ham radio calendar each year. More than 2,200
              ham radio clubs and 35,000 hams will participate in this one weekend
              of activities (for more information about Field Day, see the <i><a href="#what-is">What

              <p class="default-12">One other important aspect of Field
              Day is that hams can operate on modes and bands that they can't
              normally use. Hams that have HF privledges often act as control
              operators at their stations allowing those without HF privledges
              to operate on the HF bands. Many a new ham has gotten their first
              taste of HF operating at Field Day. For more information, see the <i><a href="#howto-contest">How
              to Contest</a></i> sidebar.

        </center>
        </font> <p class="default-10">That's a good question, and if you asked ten hams, you would probably get ten different answers. Some would say that Field Day is a contest, others would say that it is an emergency preparedness exercise, still others would say that it is a party and yet others would say that it is a public relations exercise. Who is right? They all are! Field Day is all of those things and more. The best description anyone can find is that Field Day is all of ham radio in one weekend!</p>
        <p>During Field Day, ham radio clubs, groups
            and individuals take to the field in simulated emergency conditions
          (living in tents and running on generators and batteries). They are given
          24 hours to set up as many stations as they are able. In the next 24
          hours they are try to make as many contacts as they can with those stations.
          All aspects of ham radio are used in this pursuit. More than a million
          contacts will be made on HF and VHF, CW, SSB and digital modes this weekend.
          Bonus points are awarded for making an extra effort such as making contacts
          via satellites or sending and receiving message traffic. </p>      <p> Field Day isn't just about radio though. Clubs use this biggest of
          all yearly events for many other activities. With much of the clubs membership
          assembled it is a natural time for BBQ's and other gatherings. Also with
          all of ham radio on display this weekend it is a choice time to show
          off what we do best. The media and government officials are invited to
          attend to view what ham radio can do. </p>
        <p> As you can see, Field Day is indeed all of ham radio in one weekend
          and anyone that attends their first Field Day rarely misses one again! </p>

        <center>
          <a name="howto-contest" class="headings">How to Contest</a>
        </center>
        <p></p>
        </font>
        <p> While Field Day isn't strictly a contest, that is how the entrants
          are rated and why not? A contest is a great way to evaluate a stations
          performance. It is also a great way to simulate message handling which
          will be a big part of any response to an emergency. </p>
        <p> So what is a contest? Put most simply, in a contest the objective is
          to make as many contacts in as many places as possible in a prescribed
          ammount of time. For Field Day, the objective is simply to make as many
          contacts as possible in the 24 hours you are alloted. To make those contacts
          valid, you have to exchange a certain ammount of information. The "exchange" for
          Field Day is your entry class (number of transmitters) and your ARRL
          section. </p>
        <p> So how do you go about making these contacts? Just as you would for
          any other QSO in amateur radio, there are only two ways to initiate a
          conversation. You either have to answer someone who is calling CQ or
          call CQ yourself and wait for someone to answer you. Which method is
          better? It is generally accepted that staying in one place, calling CQ
          and letting the other stations come to you is quicker and less tiring.
          However, this only works if you have a signal that is loud enough to
          attract other stations. If you aren't making any contacts or aren't making
          them fast enough, you are forced to switch to the search and pounce method.
          Excelent operators can rack up the QSOs almost as fast this way. Which
          ever method you employ, a Field Day contact sounds like this: </p>
        <blockquote> <font color="#FF0000"> CQ Field Day CQ Field Day this is W6PIY
            Whiskey Six Papa India Yankee calling CQ Field Day and listening. </font><br />
          Whiskey One Alfa Whiskey. <br />

          from another station, but learning to deal with these conditions are
          part of the lure and purpose of Field Day! </p></td>
