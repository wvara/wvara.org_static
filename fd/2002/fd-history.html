[...]
In 1994 and 1995 we were still just another 2A site.  Our FD coordinator
was Paul Nguyen KD6OCZ, who was in high school at the time (he's a network
engineer today), who helped the club rebuild its ability to hold a FD site
at all after things pretty much fell apart in 1992-1993, probably due to
California's extended recession at the time.  We tried hard and I think
those years planted the seed that got a lot of us thinking that a bigger
site might be even more fun than it is more work.  I think it also
established our Field Day effort as a chance for young Hams to be actively
involved.  Daren Bowlby AC6NS was an Extra at 14 and did 25-40wpm code,
making him our star operater all through his high school years.  Other teens
Steve Selberg KE6GDA and Mike Lyon KE6MRE helped organize and operate at the
event.  (Last we heard from them...  Daren went to college, Steve went to
the Marines and Mike remained in the valley, now a network engineer and
volunteer firefighter.)

In 1996, many WVARA members caught the vision of trying a larger site.  We
didn't know if our little club could do a big site.  Planning started in
January instead of May.  We sort of benefited from another club's troubles.
When GEARS (Golden Empire Amateur Radio Society) in Chico began severe
infighting that involved lawyers, their whole club fell apart.  I convinced
a friend from college who had also recently moved from Chico to San Jose
who had been participating with GEARS' FD, instead to coordinate WVARA's FD.
Of course, you all know who he is - Mike Polkinghorn then-KD6PUD now-K6PUD.

At first, the plan was we eventually wanted a big site but we'd start with
a "solid 2A" in 1996 just to get our act together.  But when member Mike
Sunseri AB6CW merged his 1A site with our effort, suddenly everyone took us
seriously and started volunteering stations.  Mike had to freeze the 1996
plan at 6A since it was so much bigger than anything any of us had ever
done.  Remember, every 1 or 2 stations had to have a generator so it was
difficult to grow from 2A to 6A in one year.  But we did it.  It exceeded
our expectations of turning FD from a lot of work and frustration into
a lot of work, a lot more fun, and a proud achievement.  There were
more chances for people to just drop in and operate or learn.  Good food
too (a larger effort than any station.)  It was an unqualified success.

1996 was also when previous years' efforts bore fruit and got us into the
Foothill Flea Market rotation.  Some in the Perham Foundation (who organize
the flea market) were a bit skeptical that our little club was up to the
task.  Fortunately, they never regretted letting us in.  With the 6A FD
followed by one of the better-organized flea markets there had been (credit
to Glen Lokke KE6NBO for coordinating that effort concurrent with the FD
planning), we surprised everyone again.  Adding a significant annual
fund-raiser was a necessary part of sustaining the plan for more large
Field Days.  So as many members had been wanting for years, WVARA wasn't
just a little club any more.

It was a fun coincidence that former WVARA member Rod Stafford then-KB6ZV
now-W6ROD became president of ARRL in 1996, and mentioned WVARA in his
biographical info.  (He served until 1999 and is currently ARRL's VP of
international affairs.)  And 1996 was WVARA's 40th anniversary since its
incorporation.  Quite a good year overall...

In 1997, the previous year's results and experience made it easier to do
again.  Mike K6PUD was the coordinator again.  We inched up the FD site to 7A.
We even had a couple spare generators.   One generator actually did fail just
after FD started and we just swapped it out.  It dawned on us that we
recovered easily from a problem that would have shut down 95%+ of the FD
sites out there.  We learned more - Mike began to talk about writing a
handbook for the band captains to add on to the success we'd gotten from
giving a checklist to the band captains.  We were the largest FD site in
the Bay Area this time.

In 1998, we kept the site pretty close to the same size.  But a clarification
of the rules on counting VHF stations led to previously uncounted stations
being added to the total, putting us at 10A.  Mike K6PUD was the club
president that year.  Tom Nichols KQ6OT was the FD coordinator.  A common
response we started hearing during the contest was "how many alpha?" :-)
We became the largest FD site in northern and central California this year.

In 1999, we inched up the size of the site again to 12A.  That's approaching
the limit for sites with separate generators for each small cluster of
stations.  Mike K6PUD was in his second term as president.  Dean Wood N6DE
was the FD coordinator.  It was convenient to be able to say that we were
a "dozen alpha" during contest exchanges.  We were again the largest FD site
in northern and central California, and the Pacific Division.

In 2000, we made some breakthroughs which allowed us to grow the site some
more.  (Though we only inched up to 13A while we figured out the potential.)
Svend Jensen KF6EMB brought in experience from the construction industry and
powered the whole site with a single generator, placing a transformer near
each cluster of stations where a generator had previously been.  His Field
Day power grid got the nickname of the "Svend Power and Light Company".
With Bill Ashby N6FFC as presindent Mike K6PUD returned to being the FD
coordinator this year.  We were surprised that we broke into the largest
station in California, passing the TRW Radio Club in Los Angeles.  Ironically,
this was done with the help of members of the amateur radio club from TRW's
Sunnyvale division.  But 13A also broke out our geographic territory again,
the largest FD site west of Michigan.

[...] Gary Youngs WB6G made a video of FD 2000, which helped recruiting more
than we could have imagined.  Now we could show people what Field Day was
like, not just try to describe it.

2001 was already turbulent even before September 11 turned a bad year upside
down.  The economy had been showing signs of weakness in 2000 and crashed in
early 2001, hitting Silicon Valley like nowhere else as the speculative
bubble of the dot-coms burst.  Some people's nerves were more frayed than
others, and WVARA lost its newsletter editor (twice) and then its president
just before Field Day.  Vice President Dean Wood N6DE stepped up to the
presidency and quickly picked up the pieces.  Field Day proceeded in spite
of what could have been a disaster.  Mike K6PUD was again the Field Day
coordinator.  Ron Garcia KG6BRT was the videographer.  Mike had completed
the Band Captains' Handbook he had been wanting to write for years.  Having
it all written down made his job as coordinator so much easier, he wished he
had done it sooner.  We grew the site to 18A, which turned out to be the
3rd largest FD site in the US and Canada, and the largest west of
Chesapeake Bay.  We even had a visit from ARRL Santa Clara Valley Section
Emergency Coordinator John Wray KM6GE specifically to see how we built a
small power grid and powered 18 stations with one generator.

A sign at the entrance said, "West Valley City", and "elevation 3200
population 200".

Some members (Svend Jensen KF6EMB, Bob Iannucci W6EI, Ben Loomis KG6BNL) had
been experimenting with the idea of a site-wide data network.  Though many
had skepticism whether the effort was worth it in the field, they were
allowed to proceed.  Experiments found that Cat5 ethernet cables longer than
6 feet cause and accept interference with 10m amateur radios.  That could
have been a disaster except that Svend had another rabbit in his hat.  He
had gotten lots of fiberoptic cables and network switches from dot-com
surplus.  So that became the backbone of the network - all Cat5 cables
kept 5' or less.  The network was on an experimental basis in 2001, checking
for interference.  It passed that test, allowing any of the 18 stations'
computers to browse the Internet, chat with each other, print on a networked
printer, or upload pictures of the site to WVARA's web site.  WVARA director
Chuck Kamas AD6CL, who works at a fiberoptic networking company, was surprised
to see "fiber to the tent" implemented just for a weekend while marketing
people at his work were still trying to figure out whether "fiber to the
curb" or "fiber to the house" was the next thing coming.  Ben KG6BNL (then 15)
was the network administrator.

I'm pretty sure we'll have great things to write about Field Day 2002 by the
time it's done.  Once again, we have proceeded in spite of a disaster that
came just weeks before the event.  Marc says the plan is currently 22A,
which is amazing.  The site is now so big that no one can know everything
that happenned - we have to talk about it for weeks to piece together the
whole story. :-)  But one thing which has contributed a lot to our success
is that we make sure to help credit people for their work, since we know
we're all volunteers.  Help promote the accomplishments you notice others
doing and it makes the whole event more fun for everyone.

If we keep this up, soon we'll have to elect a mayor. :-)
