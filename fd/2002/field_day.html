<h2><a name="intro">Introduction to Field Day</a></h2>
</font>
Field Day is perhaps the biggest event on the ham radio calendar each year.  Thousands of clubs and tens of thousands of hams will participate in this one weekends activies (for more information about Field Day, see the <I><a href="#what-is">What is Field Day</a></I> sidebar).  
    
    <p><font color="red">Field Day 2002 will be from June 21 through June 23, 2002 (always the 4th full weekend in June). </font>

Field Day will take place at WVARA members Charlie Norman, AB6VS and Bobbie Norman, KC6QBF's property.  Their location is the top of the Santa Cruz Mountains  near Mt. Loma Prieta. In addition to being an excelent radio location, this beautiful site has views of the Monterey Bay, Santa Cruz and Lexington Reservior from over 3,000 feet in elevation!  
(See an <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?zoom=9&mapdata=xU4YXdELrnCn7blTHxxHOMty6aRa4eyamKEOy7HeiUkQh1GtNtww0qFXlvyKUCHNXVcsfOepi8oV6aQqYpKV%2boNdJPyrXP5R2K5vIn%2bGHz4Mmcwk8cFEJj7Ok8kH9Tl2e44t1qJY4sWuwc0WU6l8HSs3daehjEPsWY4kAXP8Dl5BNIEYGI%2fJ7wkMO5W%2fo1smLvYNe4cIKyMeEUALSvL9EtilURtrCakd6JgQiY2n9s9VlKYcifdH80NtwHGJjvdnFEOT07KDz%2bTDLpUi%2fNO1o7UUXsGqRDpg9sa%2fn0rDM4GQeE8AEtB%2bqa5zGyRuWn1OqLolu3H%2f2eTpOLbjGxcj6bN%2bw0UsluyVOEQU2F2lByLqmaX2WOpOJ5%2bZGjGYb5G%2fXtCVldpbicYDl9G%2fwjNwgWfgT8FPnVRUuFrsv3iTjEOoQ4iU%2fvqKimiYHK%2bBJMdNSrK2wUP2W5I%3d" target=_top>aerial photo</a> at MapQuest/GlobeXplorer.)

<h2><a name="what-to-do">What Can You Do?</a></h2>
</font>
<p>So what can you do at Field Day?  Plenty!
<i>And visitors are welcome.</i>
WVARA has found that having as large a Field Day as possible gives the maximum ammount of people a chance to participate in the event.  No matter what you do whether it is something mainstream such as HF or VHF operation or something more rare such as digital communications or satellite work, there is a place for you.  Even if all you want to do is to pitch in and help to set the stations up or just take a look around and watch what is happening you will be welcome at any Field Day site.  
</p>

<p>
WVARA has also found that with a large site we can  compete for a good score in the contest. In the last few years, WVARA has finished as one of the top clubs in the nation.  Will you help us capture first place this year?  
</P>

<font face=Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif>
<h2><a name="what-to-bring">What to Bring</a></h2>
</font>

If you're just visiting for the day or the Saturday barbeque, bring:
<ul>
<li>lunch and any preferred personal snacks -
WVARA will provide soft drinks, breakfast, BBQ dinner and general snacks
for participants and visitors
<li>hat or cap
<li>sun block, insect repellent
<li>dress for warm days and cool, windy nights
<li>Hams - the only radio you need to bring is your mobile or handheld radio
in case you need to ask for directions enroute to the site.
Station radios were already planned months ago.
</ul>

If you'll be camping overnight Friday and/or Saturday, more items to bring:
<ul>
<li>personal tent
<li>sleeping bag
<li>toiletries/hygeine items
<li>flashlight and spare batteries (use it after dark!)
<li>mark all personal items with masking tape having your last name and
callsign so that lost&amp;found items are more easilt returned
</ul>
If you'll be staying for the weekend, park at first in the main parking
area according to the signs.
But please ask about where to park your car so that we can leave the 
parking areas clear on Saturday for BBQ attendees, so we can hold off
having to divert to the overflow parking area.
<p>
Station coordinators have already gotten their checklists on the
<a href="http://www.wvara.org/mailman/listinfo/fd-l">FD-L mail list</a>.

<h2><a name="stations">Radio Stations at Field Day</a></h2>
</font>

One other important aspect of Field Day is that hams can operate on modes and bands that they can't normally use.  Hams that have HF privledges often act as control operators at their stations allowing those without HF privledges to operate on the HF bands.  Many a new ham has gotten their first taste of HF operating at Field Day.  For more information, see the <I><a href="#howto-contest">How to Contest</a></I> sidebar.</P>  

<P>
Here is a list of who are the Field Day Band Captains
(station coordinators) for 2002.
If you wish to volunteer to help with their station, please send e-mail to "<I>Their Call</I>"@WVARA.ORG or contact the <a href="mailto:field-day@wvara.org">Field Day Coordinators</a>.
Our current planning scenario for 2002 is a "twenty two alpha" site.
(22A contest category, meaning 22 transmitters all on emergency power)

<CENTER><h2><a name="what-is">What is Field Day?</a></h2></CENTER>
</font>
<P>That's a good question, and if you asked ten hams, you would probably get ten different answers.  Some would say that Field Day is a contest, others would say that it is an emergency preparedness exercise, still others would say that it is a party and yet others would say that it is a public relations exercise.  Who is right?  They all are!  Field Day is all of those things and more.  The best description anyone can find is that Field Day is all of ham radio in one weekend!</P>

<P>During Field Day, ham radio clubs, groups and individuals take to the field in simulated emergency conditions (living in tents and running on generators and batteries).  They are given 24 hours to set up as many stations as they are able.  In the next 24 hours they are try to make as many contacts as they can with those stations.  All aspects of ham radio are used in this pursuit.   More than a million contacts will be made on HF and VHF, CW, SSB and digital modes this weekend.  Bonus points are awarded for making an extra effort such as making contacts via satellites or sending and receiving message traffic.  </P>

<P>
Field Day isn't just about radio though.  Clubs use this biggest of all yearly events for many other activities.  With much of the clubs membership assembled it is  a natural time for BBQ's and other gatherings.  Also with all of ham radio on display this weekend it is a choice time to show off what we do best.  The media and government officials are invited to attend to view what ham radio can do.  
</P>

<P>
As you can see, Field Day is indeed all of ham radio in one weekend and anyone that attends their first Field Day rarely misses one again!
</P>
<font face=Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif>
<P><CENTER><h2><a name="howto-contest">How to Contest</a></h2></CENTER></P>
</font>

<P>While Field Day isn't strictly a contest, that is how the entrants are rated and why not?  A contest is a great way to evaluate a stations performance.  It is also a great way to simulate message handling which will be a big part of any response to an emergency.  </P>

<P>So what is a contest?  Put most simply, in a contest the objective is to make as many contacts in as many places as possible in a prescribed ammount of time.  For Field Day, the objective is simply to make as many contacts as possible in the 24 hours you are alloted.  To make those contacts valid, you have to exchange a certain ammount of information.  The "exchange" for Field Day is your entry class (number of transmitters) and your ARRL section.  </P>

<P>So how do you go about making these contacts?  Just as you would for any other QSO in amateur radio, there are only two ways to initiate a conversation.  You either have to answer someone who is calling CQ or call CQ yourself and wait for someone to answer you.  Which method is better?  It is generally accepted that staying in one place, calling CQ and letting the other stations come to you is quicker and less tiring.  However, this only works if you have a signal that is loud enough to attract other stations.  If you aren't making any contacts or aren't making them fast enough, you are forced to switch to the search and pounce method.  Excelent operators can rack up the QSOs almost as fast this way.  Which ever method you employ, a Field Day contact sounds like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">CQ Field Day CQ Field Day this is <a href="http://www.wvara.org/bulletins/2002-06-001.html">K6PUD  Kilo Six Papa Uniform Delta</a> calling CQ Field Day and listening.</FONT><BR>
Whiskey One Alfa Whiskey.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">W1AW thank you, we are Twenty Two Alfa, Santa Clara Valley, over.</FONT><BR>
Thank you, we are 6 Delta, Connecticut, over.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Thank you, this is <a href="http://www.wvara.org/bulletins/2002-06-001.html">Kilo Six Papa Uniform Delta</a>, QRZ?</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

All that is left is to record the contact on your log sheet and get ready for the next contact.  </P>

<P>Obviously because of the variability of radio propagation and other factors, many contacts aren't this neat and clean.  This is especially true when multiple people are calling you or you are getting interference from another station, but learning to deal with these conditions are part of the lure and purpose of Field Day!
