	The satellite antennas aim at the sky.
	Both sets have their own azimuth-elevation 3D rotators
	in order to follow satellites as the cross the sky as fast
	as 17,000 mph (for LEO/Low Earth Orbit satellites.)
	On the left is the UHF/VHF station antennas for the LEO
	satellites.  For example, the Space Station is a LEO satellite.
	These contacted satellites at slant-line distances no further
	than about 1500 miles away, with contacts to Hams as far as Hawaii.
	On the right is the Rick Fletcher KG6IAL and Jean Fletcher KG6IAK's
	OSCAR 40 antennas.
	The OSCAR 40 satellite is in a highly elliptical orbit,
	which was successfully contacted at slant-line distances up to
	40,000 miles away, with contacts as far as New Zealand.

	The sign on the LEO Satellite station has an artist's concept
	image of the International Space Station, because it has
	a Ham Radio aboard and was the primary goal for this station.
	(We spoke with the station commander but he didn't repeat our
	callsign back to us for confirmation so we couldn't log the contact.
	Darn!)
	The sign also tells visitors the hours the station
	would be in operation,
	which was chosen for times there would be satellites in the sky
	above us and when the other satellite station wasn't operating.
	<br>
	We could only operate one satellite station at any given time
	due to a snafu in the ARRL Field Day Rules.
	We gave priority to the OSCAR 40 station for the entire OSCAR 40 pass
	from midnight to 8:30 Sunday morning.
	A rare event for Field Day, this allowed the LEO station operators
	to sleep (or help keep other stations running through the night.)

	Mike K6PUD and Fred KQ6OB at Mike's 10m CW station.
	The fact that this station was here at all was a triumph for
	Mike and for WVARA.
	Mike's house burned down in an accidental fire 3 weeks before
	Field Day, and everything he had planned for this station was lost.
	Some club members loaned the radio and antenna.
	The tent, supplies and a cooler full of cold drinks were
	provided by members and given to Mike.
	For once, all he had to do was show up.
	The club also used his callsign for the contest this year,
	thanking him for his efforts over the years as the architect
	and leader of WVARA's "Best in the West" Field Day.

	11AM Sunday - the contest portion of Field Day has just ended.
	Some people are starting to make their way to the central

	Others are still at their stations tallying up their final scores
	to provide for the site totals.

	The next thing after this is a break for snacks
	and then clean-up begins.
	With good participation from the group,
	we'll have everything torn down, packed up and every last scrap of
	debris picked up within about 3 hours.

	After I've packed up the LEO Satellite station, I relocate my truck

	In this photo, the "homeless shelter" is being taken down on the left.
	This is a tradition where I bring an extra 4-person tent for anyone
	who doesn't have a place to sleep.  Sometimes people who don't know
	what Field Day is about come to the site and, once they see it,
	they wish they could stay overnight.  Well, with this, they can.
	My personal tent remains the only one standing in the background,
	but not for long.
