Some of the teens and Grant Bowman K6CBK
(checking his handheld radio)
visit the LEO Satellite station at dusk.
The LEO station is not operating while there
are no satellites in view but it was always one of the
showcase stations at the site.
Many demonstrations and tours came through here even when
satellites weren't in view.

The satellite antennas aim at the sky.
Both sets have their own azimuth-elevation 3D rotators
in order to follow satellites as the cross the sky as fast
as 17,000 mph (for LEO/Low Earth Orbit satellites.)
On the left is the UHF/VHF station antennas for the LEO
satellites.  For example, the Space Station is a LEO satellite.
These contacted satellites at slant-line distances no further
than about 1500 miles away, with contacts to Hams as far as Hawaii.
On the right is the Rick Fletcher KG6IAL and Jean Fletcher KG6IAK's
OSCAR 40 antennas.
The OSCAR 40 satellite is in a highly elliptical orbit,
which was successfully contacted at slant-line distances up to
40,000 miles away, with contacts as far as New Zealand.

The sign on the LEO Satellite station has an artist's concept
image of the International Space Station, because it has
a Ham Radio aboard and was the primary goal for this station.
(We spoke with the station commander but he didn't repeat our
callsign back to us for confirmation so we couldn't log the contact.
Darn!)
The sign also tells visitors the hours the station
would be in operation,
which was chosen for times there would be satellites in the sky
above us and when the other satellite station wasn't operating.
<br>
We could only operate one satellite station at any given time
due to a snafu in the ARRL Field Day Rules.
We gave priority to the OSCAR 40 station for the entire OSCAR 40 pass
from midnight to 8:30 Sunday morning.
A rare event for Field Day, this allowed the LEO station operators
to sleep (or help keep other stations running through the night.)

Mike K6PUD and Fred KQ6OB at Mike's 10m CW station.
The fact that this station was here at all was a triumph for
Mike and for WVARA.
Mike's house burned down in an accidental fire 3 weeks before
Field Day, and everything he had planned for this station was lost.
Some club members loaned the radio and antenna.
The tent, supplies and a cooler full of cold drinks were
provided by members and given to Mike.
For once, all he had to do was show up.
The club also used his callsign for the contest this year,
thanking him for his efforts over the years as the architect
and leader of WVARA's "Best in the West" Field Day.

This is a pretty good representation of the size of our event,
though there are always the most people present
at the Saturday evening barbeque.
The next thing after this is a break for snacks
and then clean-up begins.
With good participation from the group,

to the residential area to get my stuff from there.
In this photo, the "homeless shelter" is being taken down on the left.
This is a tradition where I bring an extra 4-person tent for anyone
who doesn't have a place to sleep.  Sometimes people who don't know
what Field Day is about come to the site and, once they see it,
they wish they could stay overnight.  Well, with this, they can.
My personal tent remains the only one standing in the background,
but not for long.
