<p>

Before driving to the site, if you have room in an ice chest, please
<b>bring extra ice</b>.
<p>

The driving directions are
<UL>
<LI>Take Highway 17 to Summit Road.
RV drivers coming southbound from Silicon Valley will probably prefer to pass
Summit Road, turn around at the Summit Inn, and then use the northbound
exit to Summit Road, which has a much gentler turn.
<LI>Observe your odometer setting at the Summit Road exit -
you'll be looking for a turnoff 5.8 miles from here
<LI>Follow Summit Road eastbound past a school and the Summit Store.
<LI>Continue straight past Soquel-San Jose Road.
At this point the name of the road changes from Summit to Highland Way.
<LI>At the 5.8 mile mark, there is a
<a href="fd_map1.jpg">fork in the road at a stop sign</a>.
Take the road to the left, Mt Bache Road.
This winding, narrow road goes uphill.
<LI><i>Caution: There are some places where the road has washed out over
previous Winters and was repaired but is narrower.
Observe the stop signs around these areas.
RV drivers use extra caution - take it as slow as you need for safety.</i>
<LI>Observe your odometer setting again on Mt Bache Road.
You'll be looking for another turnoff in 2.7 miles.
<LI>Where
<a href="fd_map2.jpg">Mt Bache Road ends at Loma Prieta Way</a>, turn right.
The center line of the road turns that way as well so don't worry if
you miss this landmark.
<LI>At the 2.7 mile mark, you'll find a
<a href="fd_map3.jpg">left turn up a partially-paved driveway</a>
with a green street name sign "Pacific Rim".
There is also a brown mailbox labelled "29111" and "Norman".
This is the driveway to the residence of Charlie Norman AB6VS and family,
who are the hosts for the WVARA Field Day site.
(They have also hosted many previous WVARA Field Days.)
<LI><i>Note that the parking area has changed since the property on the
right of the driveway has been sold.
Follow the signs if you're not familiar.</i>
<li>Parking is now in the "pit" area.
At the intersection in the driveways, turn left and immediately right.
We anticipate that parking will overflow the pit area during the
Saturday barbeque - there is only room for less than 50 cars.
Follow the signs because we may have to use the overflow parking on
the other side of the hill for the first time.
</UL>

On your return trip down the mountain, save your brakes.
Use downshifting before braking on steep mountain roads.
<p>

If you arrive before 11AM Friday, there are important considerations
you need to follow for WVARA to comply with the Field Day Rules:
<ul>
<li>
station-related equipment
(including generators, transformers, tents, tables, data network, etc.)
can only be unloaded from vehicles
and <b>placed on the ground</b>.
According to Field Day rules, it must then wait there until 11AM.
Do not even unpack any competition items before the beginning of the
setup period.
<li>Non-competition items such as personal tents,
fire extinguishers and the food area may be set up as soon as you arrive.
</ul>
The area surrounding the concrete slab at the lookout tower frame
will be used as a staging area for arriving supplies.
However, please leave the pad itself open for setup of food operations.
<p>
All stations will have a goal to start setup on Friday
as soon as possible after 11AM
and be up on the air by 6PM to begin operational and interference testing.
<p>
Anyone who can help with cleanup after 11AM Sunday will find much
appreciation for it.
